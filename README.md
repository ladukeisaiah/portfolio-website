#Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website project, a dynamic showcase of my work, built with Next.js. This site not only highlights the projects I've completed but also offers direct links to their respective repositories on GitHub, making it a comprehensive display of my technical capabilities.

## the Design

Designed as a single-page application, my portfolio leverages Tailwind CSS for custom aesthetics, framer-motion for smooth animations, react-type-animation for dynamic typing effects, alongside HTML and JavaScript. This combination not only showcases sound design principles but also my front-end development skills, providing a user-friendly interface to display achievements, skills, education, and experience. Furthermore, the integration of an API for Sender enables direct email submissions, enhancing communication with prospective clients or employers.

This project is a testament to my ability to create visually appealing and functionally robust web applications. Through it, I demonstrate a keen eye for design, a knack for front-end technologies, and a commitment to presenting information in an accessible, engaging manner.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Each piece of the web app is built in its own component file and then imported into the page.js file where the files can all be displayed in the order we desire.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
